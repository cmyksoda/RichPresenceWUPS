# Wii U Rich Presence Plugin

This plugin uses UDP to communicate with an application on your computer to set Discord Rich Presence for the user. The activity is set based on the application currently being played, the time the application was loaded, and the amount of controllers connected.

> [!NOTE]
> After installing, if Discord incorrectly reflects the amount of time you have been playing, open the plugin configuration menu and change the "Offset 'elapsed time' timezone for correct display" setting. If elapsed time displays `0:00:00`, you need to change the setting to a negative number. If the elapsed time displays hours ahead of your actual play time, you need to change the setting to a positive number.

## Usage
Start your Wii U with the environment you placed the plugin in, and run the executable, binary, or Python file with the Discord app open.

Additionally, you can specify command-line arguments for advanced customization:
- Append `repo username/repository` to change the image repository. Replace `username/repository` with the desired GitHub repository.
- Append `port num` to change the UDP port number, where `num` is the port number you wish to use.

## Contribute
The plugin is missing images of many Wii U games. If you are interested in adding game images, and have a Github account, check out the [image repository](https://github.com/flamingnineteen/RichPresenceWUPS-DB) for this plugin.
